Purpose
========

Talkintent (Talk in Tent and Talk Intent), is my first real application using node.js
with the express framework. Since node is so good for real-time stuff, I thought
that I would work on some sort of chat client. When people have conversations in tents,
they're usually meaningful (or at least that's how it's been for me). Conveniently,
the "intent" of their talking is expressed. 

Goal
=======

Talkintent will hopefully address a major issue in instant messaging communcation -
the ability to convey tone and emotion in short-hand text. Obviously, emoticons
let people express what they are feeling, but emoticons aren't required and a good
portion of time when they're used it's for trolling or being "goofy." I want to change
that. I want people to be able to type normally, as if they were using a standard chat
client, but **somehow** be able to convey their tone. My initial idea is to have some
form of font-size/font-weight relationship to stress on certain words (hopefully 
somehow automatated, but maybe user defined? IDK).

The **somehow** is what I'll really be exploring with this project. We'll see. 
This is by no means fleshed out, but I think it's pretty cool.

Points of Inspiration/Things to Consider
=========================================

* Emoticons/Other Shapes
* Colors
* Languages intonations (think Chinese)
* Typing speed (?)
* Punctuation
* Spacing between words
* Time of day - impact on mood (?)
* Repetition of letters e.g. "no wayyyyyy!"

Other Questions and Considerations
===================================

* How does the user's mood impact their typing
* How can we trace patterns in behavior/tone of communication?
* How does sarcasm relate to the way people type
